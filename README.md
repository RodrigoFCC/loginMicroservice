# Login Microservice

This is a Spring Boot microservice that allows you to create and find users in a PostgreSQL database. It has two endpoints:

- POST /User: This endpoint creates a new user in the database by receiving a JSON object with the userâ€™s name, email and password. It validates the input and returns a success or error message.
- GET /User: This endpoint finds all the users in the database and returns them as a JSON array.
